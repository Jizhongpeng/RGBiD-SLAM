This is a reduced version of g2o, distributed together with RGBiD-SLAM.
This version is completely BSD. Source files of 1) libraries licensed under GPL or LGPL and 2) apps, examples and binaries, have been removed.
To build you will need the packages cmake and eigen3. RGBiD-SLAM uses the Eigen Sparse module for least squares minimisation.
This module is stable from version 3.1. If the package version  in Ubuntu repositories is older you can download a newer one from:

packages.yade-dem.org/precise/libeigen3-dev_3.2.1-1~precise1_all.deb
